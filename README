OK, this ‘script’ is probably one of the first coding lessons you could do at
school, but I wanted something for people to Google if they weren’t so
confident.

As mentioned in the script, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS, Braille is a script in
its own right, as such this script is outputting garbage that looks cute and
may be fun on social media for a day or two, but it is honestly not on.

How to use

```
john ~/code/braille-this ±:master ❯ ./braille-this.py rick-roll.png
⡏⣭⡍⡇⢖⠃⢀⡻⠀⡏⣭⡍⡇
⠧⠭⠥⠇⡏⣇⠟⣞⠆⠧⠭⠥⠇
⢟⠬⠶⢍⣐⣘⢚⠃⢳⣋⠅⠩⠆
⢄⣺⣹⢅⣁⢡⢏⠇⡍⠿⡜⢎⠇
⡭⠬⠥⡍⢮⠎⡲⣸⡏⠍⣿⣡⠆
⡇⠿⠇⡇⣚⣉⣫⠦⣩⠹⢟⠆⠄
⠉⠉⠉⠁⠁⠀⠀⠈⠁⠉⠀⠈⠁
```

Or you can supply a file argument and it will write to that. It will also
output via a redirect.

```
john ~/code/braille-this ±:master ❯ ./braille-this.py rick-roll.png output
```

```
john ~/code/braille-this ±:master ❯ ./braille-this.py rick-roll.png > output
```
